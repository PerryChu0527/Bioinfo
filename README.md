# Translation and Transciption project 
Without using bipython write functiona and dictionaries to analyze sequence of DNA to complement and to RNA complement of the sequence
Further confirmation of the Codon using Biopython functions.


# Chargaff Rule Project

Prove recreate Chargaff's experiments using python. 

1. Analyze the .fasta files of the genome of:
    1. Humans
    2. Plasmodium falciparum 
    3. Anopheles gambiaeas 
and calculate the %A, %T, %C, and %G. 
Conclude from analysis? 

2. Analyze the covid 19 genome and comment on the types of nucleotides there. What do you deduce about the virus from the %A, %T, %G and %C?
